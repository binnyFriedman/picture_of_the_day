# Bing Picture of the day

A simple cli program that downloads the Bing picture of the day and saves it to your computer.
It also saves yesterday's picture to a folder called "archive".

On your machine, you can run the program by typing:
```bash
$ cargo build --release && ./target/release/picture_of_the_day &
```
This is only for Linux,macOS. since windows has it built in.

Then set the wallpaper's directory to the picture of the day.<br>
